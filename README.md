# Starting Stocks technical analysis with python (growing project) 

## - starting from basic creation of dashboards, adding functionality over time

This is an simple project to aid on technical analysis for stocks. It is not intended to be a professional stock broke tool, since I am not a professional stock trader, but more of a personal project to sharpen and maintaining my python skills, and practice at the same time.
We will be adding to this readme, any addtions and improvements made over time. I don't have a set date to finish, and I don't have a set goal defined of all that can be developed in this project. 
Just have fun, learn and practice !!!   :alien:
